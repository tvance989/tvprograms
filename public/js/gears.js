/*
 * Gear terms:
 * Diametral Pitch: the ratio of the number of teeth to the pitch diameter. (See Figure 2.2, 2.2B)
 * Pitch Circle: the imaginary circle that comes in contact with the imaginary circle of another gear when the two are in mesh. (See Figure 2.2A)
 * Pitch Diameter: the diameter of the pitch circle (See Figure 2.2B)
 *
 * Tooth Dimensions:
 * Addendum: the distance from the top of a tooth to the pitch circle. (See Figure 2.2C)
 * Dedendum: the distance from the pitch circle to the root circle. It equals the addendum + the working clearance. (See Figure 2.2C)
 * Whole Depth: the distance from the top to the bottom of the gear tooth.
 * Working Depth: the total depth of a tooth space. It is equal to the addendum + the dedendum (or the working depth + the variance).
 * Working Clearance: the distance from the working depth to the root circle. (See Figure 2.2C)
